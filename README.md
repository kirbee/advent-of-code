# Advent of Code

Just a repo where I try to complete the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) questions.

Each year has its own directory, with each date having it's own directory in the year ... for example, Dec 04 2020:
`2020/04`

## Puzzle info
Each day will contain:
1. A README.md with instructions how to run it
1. A file `input.txt` containing my specific puzzle input
1. A copy of the text of the puzzle in `[DD].txt`
